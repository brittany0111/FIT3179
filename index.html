            <h2>Percentage of Forest Reserves Across Malaysian States in 2021</h2>
            <div class="choropleth-section">
                <div id="choropleth"></div>
                <p> <span class="bold-purple">By 2021</span>, Malaysia's forest reserves were heavily concentrated in Sabah, Perak, and Pahang,
                    In contrast, urban centers like Kuala Lumpur and coastal regions such as
                    Penang show little forest cover. This contrast highlights not only where nature
                    thrives, but also where <span class="bold-purple">urgent conservation</span> are needed to protect
                    these critical ecosystems.</p>

            <h2>Which states are protecting the highest percentage of their land?</h2>
            <div class="bump-section">
                <p> <span class="bold-violet">Sabah</span> and <span class="bold-green">Perak</span> stand out as strong guardians of
                    their forests, consistently dedicating large portions of their land to conservation. Meanwhile,
                    other states show shifting trends. For example, <span class="bold-blue">Kedah</span> improved their protection levels in 2013,
                    whereas <span class="bold-orange">Pahang</span> lost ground as
                    development expands in 2009. This changing landscape tells a story not just of policy and land use, but of
                    how each state weighs the balance between progress and preservation.</p>

                <div id="bar"></div>
                <p><span class="bold-red">Sabah, Sarawak</span>, and <span class="bold-red">Pahang</span> stand out with the
                    <span class="bold-red">highest tree cover loss</span> in Malaysia,
                    not because they neglect their forests, but because they have the most to lose.<br></br>
                    These states are home to some of the country's richest and most expansive forests,
                    so even small clearings for logging or agriculture add up to <span class="bold-red">large losses</span> on the map.
                    Their vast green landscapes, once endless, now tell a story of both abundance and vulnerability.</p>

            <h2>The Forces Behind the Falling Trees</h2>
            <div class="donut-section">
                <p><span class="bold-teal">Permanent Agriculture</span> has been the leading force behind forest loss, as vast tracts of land are
                    cleared to make way for oil palm and rubber plantations that fuel Malaysia's economy.</p>

                <p><span class="bold-dark-orange">Logging</span>, while often regulated, continues to chip away at old-growth forests, fragmenting habitats and weakening the natural balance that sustains biodiversity.</p>

            <h2>Signs of Renewal: Tree Cover Expansion (2000-2020)</h2>
            <div class="prop-section">
                <div id="prop_symbol"></div>
            </div>
            <p>Similar to the bar chart on tree cover loss, <span class="bold-dark-blue">Sarawak, Sabah, and Pahang</span>
                    continue to stand out in tree cover gain. These states record the <span class="bold-dark-blue">highest
                    forest regeneration</span>, reflecting their vast land areas and ongoing reforestation
                    or plantation activities. The pattern suggests that regions experiencing the
                    most deforestation are also those with the most efforts and capacity for regrowth.</p>

                <p>Overall, Malaysia's forest trends reveal a complex balance between loss and recovery. While
                    extensive deforestation persists in several regions, strong replanting and natural regeneration
                    efforts help offset some of the damage. <span class="bold-dark-blue">Sustaining this balance</span> will depend on long-term
                    conservation strategies that prioritize both economic needs and environmental resilience.</p>
