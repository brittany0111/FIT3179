            <h1>Malaysia's Forestry Scene</h1>
        </div>


        <h2>Percentage of Forest Reserves Across Malaysian States in 2021</h2>
        <div class="choropleth-section">
            <div id="choropleth"></div>
            <p> <span class="bold-purple">By 2021</span>, Malaysia's forest reserves were heavily concentrated in Sabah, Perak, and Pahang,
                In contrast, urban centers like Kuala Lumpur and coastal regions such as
                Penang show little forest cover. This contrast highlights not only where nature
                thrives, but also where <span class="bold-purple">urgent conservation</span> are needed to protect
                these critical ecosystems.</p>
        </div>
    

        <h2>Forest Reserve Area by State (2003-2021)</h2>
        <div class="line-chart-section">
            <div id="line"></div>
        </div>

        <h2>Which states are protecting the highest percentage of their land?</h2>
        <div class="bump-section">
            <p> <span class="bold-violet">Sabah</span> and <span class="bold-green">Perak</span> stand out as strong guardians of
                their forests, consistently dedicating large portions of their land to conservation. Meanwhile,
                other states show shifting trends. For example, <span class="bold-blue">Kedah</span> improved their protection levels in 2013,
                whereas <span class="bold-orange">Pahang</span> lost ground as
                development expands in 2009. This changing landscape tells a story not just of policy and land use, but of
                how each state weighs the balance between progress and preservation.</p>

        <h2>The Forces Behind the Falling Trees</h2>
        <div class="donut-section">
            <div id="donut"></div>
            <p><span class="bold-teal">Permanent agriculture</span> has been the leading force behind forest loss, as vast tracts of land are
                cleared to make way for oil palm and rubber plantations that fuel Malaysia's economy.<br><br>
                <span class="bold-dark-orange">Logging</span>, while often regulated, continues to chip away at old-growth forests, fragmenting habitats and weakening the natural balance that sustains biodiversity.</p>
