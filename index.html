        <h1>Malaysia's Forestry Scene</h1>
        <p class="intro-para">Malaysia is home to some of the world's most <span class="bold">biodiverse tropical forests</span>, which
            play a crucial role in maintaining ecological balance, supporting livelihoods,
            and mitigating climate change. Over the past two decades, however, the country
            has faced <span class="bold">growing challenges</span> in balancing economic development with forest
            conservation. This visualization explores the dynamics of Malaysia's forestry
            landscape, from the extent of forest reserves across states to changes in tree
            cover and the drivers of forest loss, offering insights into how conservation
            efforts have evolved over time.</p>
