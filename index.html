            <h1>Malaysia's Forestry Scene</h1>
        </div>


        <h2>Percentage of Forest Reserves Across Malaysian States in 2021</h2>
        <div class="choropleth-section">
            <div id="choropleth"></div>
            <p> <span class="bold">By 2021</span>, Malaysia's forest reserves were heavily concentrated in <span class="bold">Sabah, Perak, and Pahang</span>,
                In contrast,
                urban centers like <span class="bold">Kuala Lumpur</span> and coastal regions such as
                <span class="bold">Penang</span> show little forest cover. This contrast highlights not only where nature
                thrives, but also where <span class="bold">urgent conservation</span> are needed to protect
                these critical ecosystems.</p>

        <h2>Forest Reserve Area by State (2003-2021)</h2>

            <div id="line"></div>
        </div>

        <h2>Which states are protecting the highest percentage of their land?</h2>
        <div class="bump-section">
            <p> <span class="bold">Sabah</span> and <span class="bold-green">Perak</span> stand out as strong guardians of
                their forests, consistently dedicating large portions of their land to conservation. Meanwhile,
                other states show shifting trends. For example, <span class="bold-blue">Kedah</span> improved their protection levels in 2013,
                whereas <span class="bold-orange">Pahang</span> lost ground as
                development expands in 2009. This changing landscape tells a story not just of policy and land use, but of
                how each state weighs the balance between progress and preservation.</p>

        <h2>The Forces Behind the Falling Trees</h2>
        <div class="donut-section">
            <div id="donut"></div>
            <p>Malaysia's forests have long felt the weight of human ambition, with <span class="bold-teal">permanent agriculture</span>
                and <span class="bold-dark-orange">logging</span> leading the charge. Vast stretches of land once rich in biodiversity have been
                cleared for oil palm and rubber plantations, while <span class="bold-dark-orange">logging</span> steadily erodes what remains.
                These forces reveal a story of growth and loss, where economic progress has often come at
                nature's expense. Yet, by recognizing these drivers, Malaysia can begin to steer toward a
                future where forests and development grow side by side.
