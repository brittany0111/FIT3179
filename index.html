            <p class="intro-para">Malaysia's forests are among the most biodiverse in the world, supporting both nature and communities. However, rapid development has challenged conservation. This visualization examines forest reserves, tree cover trends, and the causes of forest loss, revealing changes in conservation over time.</p>

        <h2>Percentage of Forest Reserves Across Malaysian States - 2021</h2>

            <p>In 2021, forest reserves were concentrated mostly in the states of Sabah, Perak
                and Pahang. In contrast, highly urbanized areas like Kuala Lumpur 
                and coastal shores like Penang have very little forest cover.
                This distribution highlights the regions that are most critical for conservation and sustainable management.</p>
